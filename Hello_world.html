      /*One of the common ways of representing color is the RGB color model, in which the Red, Green, and Blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.

One of the ways to determine brightness of a color is to find the value V of the alternative HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model. Value is defined as the largest component of a color:

V = max(R,G,B)
You are given a list of colors in 6-digit hexidecimal notation #RRGGBB. Return the brightest of these colors!

For example,

brightest(["#001000", "#000000"]) == "#001000"
brightest(["#ABCDEF", "#123456"]) == "#ABCDEF"
If there are multiple brightest colors, return the first one:

brightest(["#00FF00", "#FFFF00", "#01130F"]) == "#00FF00"
Note that both input and output should use upper case for characters A, B, C, D, E, F.*/

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns . Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of , , , and ."now"yearsdayshoursminutesseconds
It is much easier to understand with an example:
* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"

Note that spaces are important.
Detailed rules
The resulting expression is made of components like , , etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.4 seconds1 year
The components are separated by a comma and a space (). Except the last component, which is separated by , just like it would be written in English. ", "" and "
A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, is not correct, but is.1 second and 1 year1 year and 1 second
Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in .5 seconds and 1 second
A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, is not valid, but it should be just .1 minute and 0 seconds1 minute
A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return , but instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.61 seconds1 minute and 1 sec*/
